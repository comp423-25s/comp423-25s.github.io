## About

Hey, my name is Benjamin, I'm a senior majoring in Computer Science and Mathematics from Oak Island, NC. This is my first semester as a COMP 423 TA, although you may recognize me as a longtime COMP 110 TA. This class was super useful for me to learn about full-stack development in general as well as how to work well in a team on a large coding project. Outside of this class I enjoy cryptography, hardware security, and other systems and theoretical topics in computer science. I hope to be pursuing a master's degree in CS at UNC next year!

For fun, I am a huge card games guy and the games I play include MTG, Balatro, and recently Slay the Spire. I also follow the NBA and NFL pretty closely, especially to see how former UNC players are doing. Feel free to connect via the links below, and I hope you all enjoy the class!
