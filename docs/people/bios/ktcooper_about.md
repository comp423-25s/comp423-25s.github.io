## About
Hi, my name is Katie Fort! I’m a third-year undergraduate student at UNC, majoring in Computer Science (B.S.) with minors in Data Science and Studio Art, focusing on ceramics.

This is my first semester as a TA for 423. I took the class in Fall 2024, and it was definitely one of the most applicable CS courses I’ve had at UNC! I’m excited to continue developing the class with Kris and the 423 team this semester.

In my free time, I love going on walks, cooking, doing yoga, and reading. I also enjoy hiking and getting outdoors—if you have any great nearby hike recommendations, I’d love to hear them!
