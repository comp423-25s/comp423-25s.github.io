## About Me

Hi everyone! Thanks for checking out my bio! As you may already know, my name is Mitchell Anderson. I am from Winston Salem, North Carolina and I am a junior  pursuing a Computer Science BS and minors in both Math and Economics. This is my 3rd semester as a ULA and my 1st semester with COMP 423. I have a focus on fullstack web development. Last summer I completed a fullstack software engineering internship in Santa Clara, California at a tech company called ServiceNow.

Other than computer science, I enjoy working out, mountain biking, skiing, hanging with friends, and watching UNC Basketball. I also enjoy a good fortnite game from time to time. 

Feel free to connect with me and ask me any questions abour projects, software engineering, or anything else that might pique your interest. I'm looking forwaard to meeting you all!
