## About
Hi! I'm Alicia Bao, a third-year CS and Sociology major with a minor in Information Systems. This is my first semester TAing for 423 and my second semester TAing overall. My project for this course was digital signage (*not the one being merged in but* shoutout to Shaina, Daisy, and Sherly!) and it was the first time I had worked in a full stack. 

Outside of thinking about CS, I love looking at cool data viz projects, updating my Beli, painting, and advocating for an Asian American Studies program at UNC.
