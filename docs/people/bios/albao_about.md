## About
Hi! I'm Alicia Bao, a third-year CS and Sociology major. This is my first semester TAing for 423 and my second semester TAing overall. My project for this course was digital signage (*not the one being merged in but* shoutout to my teamâ€“ Shaina, Daisy, and Sherly!) and it was the first time I had worked in a full stack. 

Outside of thinking about CS, I love looking at [cool data viz projects](https://pudding.cool/2021/01/oreo/){:target="_blank"}, updating my Beli, painting, and advocating for an Asian American Studies program at UNC.
