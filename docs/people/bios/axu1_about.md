## About Me

Hello! I am a junior from New Jersey graduating with CS and Statistics B.S. degrees. I took Kris's 423 last semester and had a fantastic time learning about software engineering, but also about the teaching and collaboration process. I worked on the organization roster feature with [Alanna](./alanna26_about.md). This will be my sole experience TA-ing, but I have held other leadership/teaching positions in various clubs.

Namely, I am active in the Game Development Club (game development), CS for Social Good (web app development/consulting), and Chapel Thrill Escapes (on-campus escape room). I am also currently working part-time at SAS (started summer 2024) as a frontend developer. I would be happy to help out or talk to you about any of these experiences - just email me or find a way to contact me somehow.

Outside of CS activities, I frequent BeaM's Murray wood shop and make various crafts. I also enjoy practicing piano/recorder, growing herbs, and developing/playing games for fun. I enjoy playing rhythm games and developing RPG games the most!
