## About

Hello! My name is Alanna Zhang. I'm a third-year Computer Science major with minors in Data Science and Statistics, and this is my first semester TA-ing for 423. I really enjoyed the collaborative aspect of this course, and my favorite part was working on the final project: an organization roster management system. For fun, I like to doodle and am currently attempting to get better at using colors in digital art.
