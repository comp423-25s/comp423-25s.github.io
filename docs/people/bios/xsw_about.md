## About Me

Hi there! My name is Sunny Wang. I'm a fourth-year Computer Science major (B.S.) with a double major in Economics and a minor in Business Administration. This is my first semester TA-ing for 423, but actually my seventh (and last) semester TAing for the CS department. I'm really grateful for this course for teaching me so many valuable skills that I can apply in industry work. Being a TA is so awesome because I get to deepen my understanding on topics and work with such a wonderful team. As for hobbies, I like to cook, play racket/paddle sports, watch films, and travel!
