## About
Hi, my name is Shaina Patel! Iâ€™m a junior double majoring in Computer Science and Linguistics and minoring in Studio Arts. 

I'm a previous COMP 110 TA and this is my first semester as a COMP 423 TA. By taking COMP 423 I've learned so many industry applicable skills. I really enjoyed the collaborative feature of this class and can't wait for this semester!

In my free time I love to cook food, create playlists, run, and crochet!
