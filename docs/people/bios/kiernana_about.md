## About

Hello!! My name is Kiernan Almand and I am a Computer Science major and Data Science minor graduating this May. I am from Alexandria, Virginia and while I think it is the greatest city in the world, I also love to travel. In May 2023, I traveled to Copenhagen where I took a COMP 590 course with Kris Jordan and during Spring 2024 I studied at the National University of Singapore!

This is my second semester as a TA for 423 and it has been #epic :sunglasses:. This class taught me so much when I took it in Fall 2023 and I continue to learn from it every day as a TA.

When I am not in office hours, I like to listen to podcasts (5-4, Binchtopia, and Normal Gossip are my favs), do yoga, draw, and drink coffee.
