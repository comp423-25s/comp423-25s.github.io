# EX00 - Collaborating on Technical Documentation

## Learning Objectives

Welcome to your first pair project! This exercise aims to build your skills in several key areas:

* **Starting Projects**: Learn how to create a new project using today’s development tools.
* **Using Technical Documentation**: Get better at finding, reading, and using guides and manuals to achieve your goals on your own.
* **Writing Technical Documentation**: Improve at writing clear instructions for others on how to do technical tasks.
* **Teamwork with Git**: Develop your ability to work with others using git, focusing on how to manage changes and updates in your work effectively.

## Deliverable Overview

You and your partner will work together to produce:

1. **Tutorial Guides** (50 points): Each of you will write a tutorial for setting up a basic project from scratch, one of you for the Go programming language and the other for the Rust programming language. You’ll publish your guide on your personal MkDocs site. Your partner will help by reviewing and suggesting improvements to your guide.
    * 20 points - Well fomatted markdown and use of appropriate MkDocs for Material features (e.g. code fences, admonitions)
    * 30 points - Tutorial includes required components (brief intro, git repo setup, dev container setup, initialize a project, add a hello world example, compile and run)
2. **Project Repositories** (20 points): Host the projects resulting from your tutorials on GitHub and make them public.
3. **EX00 Git Workflow Adherence** (30 points): You will be asked to show how you followed the specific `git` workflow expectations we have in this exercise. This will be preserved in your `git` repository's history (e.g. via `log`) and we will show you how to share it via your GitHub repository. Especially of note: all merging for this exercise will be done using the `--no-ff` flag which forces the creation of merge commits, even when `git` could have otherwise fast-forwarded. It’s important to understand this and practice it from the start of this exercise. Additionally, **we will ==NOT== use Pull Requests (PRs)** yet in order to become facile with `git`'s fundamental collaboration commands which will also be useful for working with PRs when we get there.

## Getting Started with Collaborative Development

Welcome to your first collaborative development exercise! You'll be working with a partner to create and improve technical documentation while practicing essential Git workflows. This guide will help you understand how developers collaborate directly using Git's core features, without relying on GitHub's pull request system.

### Initial Setup: Repository Access

The first step is to give your partner access to your repository and get access to theirs. This exchange of access permissions enables direct collaboration between team members.

#### Setting Up Repository Access

Navigate to your comp423-course-notes repository on GitHub (the one you created in the previous tutorial) and follow these steps:

1. Go to Settings > Collaborators
2. Click "Add people"
3. Enter your partner's GitHub username
4. Select their account and send the invitation

Your partner will need to accept the invitation via email or through GitHub's interface before they can contribute to your repository. Make sure you both complete this step before proceeding.

#### Protecting Your Repository with Rulesets

Even though you've added your partner as a collaborator, you'll want to protect your main branch through a ruleset. Rulesets are GitHub's modern approach to repository security, allowing you to define who can make what kinds of changes to your codebase. Let's set one up and understand what each setting does.

Navigate to your repository's Settings page on GitHub and follow these steps:

1. Click on "Rules" in the left sidebar under "Code and automation"
2. Click "New rule" to create a ruleset
3. Configure your ruleset with these settings:

**Basic Settings:**

- Name your ruleset `main` 
- For "Enforcement status," select "Active"
- Add "Repository admin" (this is you, the repository owner) to the bypass list
- Under "Target," choose "Branch" and select your repository's default branch

**Rules:**

- Enable "Restrict creations"
- Enable "Restrict updates"
- Enable "Restrict deletions"
- Leave everything else disabled

Let's understand what each of these settings means and why they're important:

**Targeting the Default Branch:** Your default branch (in your project, this is `main`) is the primary branch of your repository.

**Restrict Creations, Updates, and Deletions:** These three settings work together to control who can make changes to your default branch. When enabled, only people in the bypass list (in this case, just you) can create new commits on the primary branch, update existing commits, or delete the branch entirely. Your collaborators will need to work in separate feature branches, which helps maintain a clean and organized codebase.

These rules reflect a simplified real-world setup. Your partner can still create branches, make changes, and participate fully in development - they just can't modify the protected `main` branch directly. That's your job!

### Cloning Your Partner's Repository

Since you already have your own repository set up locally from the previous tutorial, you just need to clone your partner's repository. Because both repositories have the same name, you'll want to specify a different directory name when cloning to avoid conflicts:

```bash
# Clone your partner's repository with a descriptive directory name
git clone https://github.com/<partner>/comp423-course-notes.git partner-notes
```

For example, if your partner's GitHub username is "student2", you might run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/student2/comp423-course-notes.git student2-notes
```

After cloning, set up the development container for your partner's repository by opening the new directory in VS Code and reopening it in a container, just as you did with your own repository in the previous tutorial.

### Understanding Direct Git Collaboration

When developers work together without using pull requests, they rely on Git's fundamental commands to share and integrate changes. This approach helps you understand how Git works at its core. Here's the basic flow:

1. You work on changes in your own repository
2. Your partner clones your repository and makes suggestions
3. You fetch and merge their suggestions locally
4. After reviewing and testing, you merge changes into your main branch
5. You push the updated main branch back to GitHub

This workflow requires careful coordination between team members and a solid understanding of Git's core commands. Let's explore how to use these commands effectively.

### Git Workflow Expectations 

#### Core Commands You'll Use

- `git fetch`: Downloads changes from the remote repository
- `git switch`: Changes between branches
- `git branch`: Creates new branches
- `git merge`: Combines changes from different branches
- `git push`: Shares your changes with the remote repository

#### Creating and Managing Branches

Always create a new branch for your work:

```bash
# Create and switch to a new branch
git switch -c feature/add-tutorial-content

# As you work, commit regularly with meaningful messages
git add docs/tutorials/go-setup.md
git commit -m "Add initial project setup instructions for Go"
```

#### Sharing Your Work

When ready to share your changes:

```bash
# Push your feature branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/add-tutorial-content
```

#### Reviewing Partner's Work

When your partner has pushed changes for review:

1. Fetch the latest changes from their repository:
   ```bash
   git fetch origin
   ```

2. Switch to their feature branch:
   ```bash
   git switch feature/add-tutorial-content
   ```

3. Review their changes locally, running their tutorial to verify it works

#### Providing Feedback

To suggest improvements to your partner's work:

1. While on their feature branch, create a feedback branch:
   ```bash
   git switch -c feedback/tutorial-improvements
   ```

2. Make your suggested changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Improve formatting and add troubleshooting section"
   ```

3. Push your feedback branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feedback/tutorial-improvements
   ```

#### Merging Changes

When merging changes in this exercise, **always use the `--no-ff` flag to preserve the merge history**:

```bash
# First, switch to your main branch
git switch main

# Update your local main branch
git fetch origin
git merge origin/main

# Merge your feature branch with --no-ff
git merge --no-ff feature/add-tutorial-content

# Push the merged changes to GitHub
git push origin main
```

## Understanding the Process

This workflow emphasizes direct collaboration and communication between team members. By working without pull requests, you'll gain a deeper understanding of:

- How changes move between local and remote repositories
- The importance of clear communication in collaborative development
- The role of branching in managing parallel work
- How merging brings changes together
- The significance of maintaining a clear project history

Remember that in real-world projects, teams often use pull requests to add additional process and review structures. However, understanding these fundamental Git operations will make you a more effective collaborator regardless of the specific workflow your team uses.



## Assignment Structure

You and your partner will each create a tutorial about setting up a new DevContainer project. One of you will focus on Go, while the other will work on Rust. Here's how to organize the work:

1. Decide with your partner who will take which language
2. Create a new directory in your docs folder: `docs/tutorials/`
3. Create your tutorial file: `docs/tutorials/go-setup.md` or `docs/tutorials/rust-setup.md`
4. Update your `mkdocs.yml` to include the new tutorial in your navigation

## Tutorial Content Requirements

Your tutorials should include:

1. Prerequisites and environment setup
2. Step-by-step instructions for creating a new DevContainer project
3. Configuration file explanations
4. Basic "Hello COMP423" implementation
5. Common issues and troubleshooting tips

Make use of Material for MkDocs features to enhance your documentation:

- Code blocks with syntax highlighting for configuration files and commands
- Diagrams showing the project structure or workflow
- Admonitions for important notes and warnings
- Icons and emoji where appropriate


## Need Help?

- If you encounter Git issues, try running `git status` and `git log` to understand your current state
- When in doubt, communicate with your partner about the current state of changes
- For language-specific questions, consult the official documentation
- If you're still stuck, reach out to your instructor or TAs

Remember to commit early and often, and always use the `--no-ff` flag when merging to maintain a clear history of collaboration.
